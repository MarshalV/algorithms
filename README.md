## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It works for both directed and undirected graphs, but it does not work with negative cycles.

## Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

## Breadth-First Search

Breadth-first search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It's a greedy algorithm that finds the single-source shortest path for a graph with non-negative edge weights.

## Euclid's Algorithm

Euclid's algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. It relies on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.

## Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

## HashTable

A Hash Table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is used for pattern searching in a string. It efficiently finds occurrences of a "word" within a main "text" by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin.

## Longest Common Subsequence

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is to find the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences. It differs from problems of finding common substrings: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.

## RSA Encryption

RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm widely used for secure data transmission. It involves the use of public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Sorting Algorithms

This section includes various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort. Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange a collection of items into a particular order.

## TF-IDF Algorithm

Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a numerical statistic used to reflect the importance of a term in a document relative to a collection of documents. It's commonly used in information retrieval and text mining.
